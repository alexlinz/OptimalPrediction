#16S Best Practices
Please cite xxx


##Fast Run Instructions

Appropriate uses of the fast run instructions:
 - I don't care about parameters, I just want to see if your code works
 - I've already run this 30 times and my advisor wants just one more change
 - Give me the really short version of what you're doing

Inappropriate uses:
 - Reading this for your first pass through instead of the very detailed tutorial below
 - Running this code on data that is not identical to the published dataset
 - Anything that needs parameters tweaked or visual inspection of quality data

```{bash, eval = F}
# From the folder 16S_best_practices on a CHTC submit node:
# Install python, qiime, and ea-utils (for read joining)
condor_submit -i submits/install_qiime.sub

# List UW sequenced samples that need to be processed
./scripts/list_uw_samples.sh

# QC UW samples to the same level as the EMP samples
condor_submit submits/00uwbcquality_control.sub

# Check for the results files
ls -ltrh /mnt/gluster/amlinz/NTL-MO/UW-processed/

# Make plots of the quality scores for both the UW and EMP samples


```
